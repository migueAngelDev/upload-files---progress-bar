# upload-files---progress-bar
## Project details
---
-  *I used the *axios* library instead of *fetch* because it makes the POST write request easier to send to the server.*
- *I used a service called [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) to upload and store the files so that it will simulate a server.*
